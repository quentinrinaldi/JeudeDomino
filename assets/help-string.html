                        <div>To play a tile on the draw, it is necessary to use the way of the <em>drag and drop</em>. Touch the tile you want to play (on the hand on the lower side of the screen), then while touching it move your finger to the side of the board whre you want to play and release it above the one of the two rectangles nearer your chosen end of the board. However, releasing a tile over the rectangle does not garanty the validity of the strike. Unless the end of the board matches your tile, this action will have no effect whatsoever.</div>

                    <div>Should the domino not match your chosen end of the board, the tile you have displaced will reappear in your hand once you release it (<em>drop</em> it) the only purpose of the rectangles is to show the area where a tile may be dropped to effect the board.</div>
